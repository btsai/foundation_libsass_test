This bower_components folder was set up by the task recommended here:

* http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html
<pre>
  $> foundation new MY_PROJECT --libsass
</pre>

In addition to creating the bower_components folder, these are also installed:
Gruntfile.js
package.json
bower.json
css
├── # we're using the rails setup + app/scss instead
js
├── # we're using the rails asset pipeline setup instead
node_modules
├── grunt
├── grunt-contrib-watch
├── grunt-sass
├── node-sass
bower_components
├── foundation
├── jquery
├── modernizr

We aren't really using bower for much, except for this initial installation, so perhaps at some point in the future we can remove the extra stuff.
